## What we are looking for

XcodeGPT is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into XcodeGPT itself.

## Ground Rules

- Ensure that code that goes into core meets all requirements in this checklist: [Code Review Checklist](CodeReviewChecklist.md) (In progress)
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/).

- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/JackieQi/XcodeGPT/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

## Getting started

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    - Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    - Check for any conflicts with the base branch.
    - Send a pull request.

## How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email the owner instead.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of XcodeGPT are you using?
2. What did you do?
3. What did you expect to see?
4. What did you see instead?

## Code review process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After feedback has been given, we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks, we may close the PR if it isn't showing any activity.

## Community

You can chat in **Discussion** channel. We try to be around all the time, but we are more likely to be available during regular business hours.
